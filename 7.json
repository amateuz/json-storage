Here is the call summary (for extra transparency):**\n\n1. Drop repair costs from 500 sats -> 100 sats (we're here to ensure people have ckBTC to transact, not to punish whales that have to upgrade dozens and dozens of Motokos).\n\n2. Glitch will be randomly distributed as airdrop to a lucky Motoko Sentinel holder (as discussed previously here, works best)\n\n3. A portion of revenue from the launch will go to cover Bioniq launch fee, Bioniq custom dev, Jon's artwork, and inscription fees on Bitcoin. The rest will go to treasury. Still finalizing percentages here.\n\n4. Motokos are separate from the Poked Bot ecosystem. There can be cross-overs, but they are clearly distinct communities (for legal reasons as well as separation of concerns reasons). So we'll leep the lore separate between Motokos and Poked Bots to keep distance between the two collections.\n\n5. It may be helpful to add a setting for users to add a parenthetical price in ICP instead of dollars for the ICP users in the community that prefer accounting in ICP (rather than ckBTC or $$).\n\n6. Simplify the process of onboarding from ICP -> ckBTC. Still painful to swap. Consider building in swapping functionality (and holding ICP) directly into Bioniq.\n\n7. We need to get listed on Crypto Slam (or other NFT tracking services). Anyone have any connections here? Let's get Motokos on the cross-chain map.\n\n8. Update on PR article. They want it a bit sexier. So we're spicing it up with data/future plans. A few more rounds of review before they start pitching to NFT outlets.\n\n9. This project only succeeds with community support. How can we effectively include people in building the Motoko lore, contributing to game mechanics, etc.?\n\n10. Some people have had bad luck with their Motokos on missions. Others have had crazy success. Maybe we have a leaderboard showing best Motoko of the week (best luck on missions) and worst motoko of the week (worst luck on missions).","attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2024-04-23T17:58:13.839000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-23T18:07:31.555000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1232390088667828355","author":{"id":"846842864650551346","username":"bobbodily","avatar":"deaaa06d2f5a1011ae7c8f2f5604d4a6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Bob Bodily","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false},"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"libi5629"},{"id":"1232394441126576171","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"846842864650551346","username":"bobbodily","avatar":"deaaa06d2f5a1011ae7c8f2f5604d4a6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Bob Bodily","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"1.

Level 4 XP earning the most. Level 3 XP earning next most. Level 2 XP earning next most. Level 1 XP earning next most. And 0 XP earning 0 tokens. There is likely some distribution based on XP for your Motokos (cap at 2000 XP, so any amount over 2000 XP doesn't matter). Maybe linear. Maybe quadratic so level 4 get the most.\n\n3.

Level 4 XP earning the most. Level 3 XP earning next most. Level 2 XP earning next most. Level 1 XP earning next most. And 0 XP earning 0 tokens. There is likely some distribution based on XP for your Motokos (cap at 2000 XP, so any amount over 2000 XP doesn't matter). Maybe linear. Maybe quadratic so level 4 get the most.\n\n3.
