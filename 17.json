(1) Thank you for looking at that chart and investigating. The color code is explained in the OP. The green represents outflows to a potential LP. I say potential, because I can only track it as far as what looks to be the sonic DEX wallet. I’m new to ICP and am only starting to build a database of the wallets. After this point, there is a black hole. Sonic does not provide the LP history. They gatekeep the data.\n\nIn total accumulating sent 3.8 $motoko to a potential LP. A small amount considering their total Motoko holdings. In addition, accumulating keeps saying that he provided “exit liquidity”. That’s not how this works, we’re not trading on a orderbook. This is all on AMM DEX’s.\n\nPerhaps what accumulating means is that he was buying $motoko from the LP when others were selling Motoko to the LP. In this case he is not providing “exit liquidity”, rather he is propping up the price of $motoko as others are selling it.\n\nHere's the point I was making. Accumulating is the founder of the project. To instill confidence, it would have been very beneficial if he locked up all his motoko/ICP pair in the LP. This would provide clear verifiable evidence he was not rugging.\n\nThere are still a few questionable things that accumulating has done here. After being very inactive, they suddenly woke up and bought 25+ Motoko’s 2 weeks before the announcement and they sold 13 Motoko’s after they pumped. TBH, I don’t care about that.

(1) Thank you for looking at that chart and investigating. The color code is explained in the OP. The green represents outflows to a potential LP. I say potential, because I can only track it as far as what looks to be the sonic DEX wallet. I’m new to ICP and am only starting to build a database of the wallets. After this point, there is a black hole. Sonic does not provide the LP history. They gatekeep the data.\n\nIn total accumulating sent 3.8 $motoko to a potential LP. A small amount considering their total Motoko holdings. In addition, accumulating keeps saying that he provided “exit liquidity”. That’s not how this works, we’re not trading on a orderbook. This is all on AMM DEX’s.\n\nPerhaps what accumulating means is that he was buying $motoko from the LP when others were selling Motoko to the LP. In this case he is not providing “exit liquidity”, rather he is propping up the price of $motoko as others are selling it.\n\nHere's the point I was making. Accumulating is the founder of the project. To instill confidence, it would have been very beneficial if he locked up all his motoko/ICP pair in the LP.

(1) Thank you for looking at that chart and investigating. The color code is explained in the OP. The green represents outflows to a potential LP. I say potential, because I can only track it as far as what looks to be the sonic DEX wallet. I’m new to ICP and am only starting to build a database of the wallets. After this point, there is a black hole. Sonic does not provide the LP history. They gatekeep the data.\n\nIn total accumulating sent 3.8 $motoko to a potential LP. A small amount considering their total Motoko holdings. In addition, accumulating keeps saying that he provided “exit liquidity”. That’s not how this works, we’re not trading on a orderbook. This is all on AMM DEX’s.\n\nPerhaps what accumulating means is that he was buying $motoko from the LP when others were selling Motoko to the LP. In this case he is not providing “exit liquidity”, rather he is propping up the price of $motoko as others are selling it.\n\nHere's the point I was making. Accumulating is the founder of the project. To instill confidence, it would have been very beneficial if he locked up all his motoko/ICP pair in the LP. This would provide clear verifiable evidence he was not rugging.\n\nThere are still a few questionable things that accumulating has done here. After being very inactive, they suddenly woke up and bought 25+ Motoko’s 2 weeks before the announcement and they sold 13 Motoko’s after they pumped. TBH, I don’t care about that.

Mr @notforsale22 do have one point I agree on though! \n\nIt's not a fair distribution so far. Yes he might not have 8 NFTs, but no matter if it is 8 or 1 - he and other people haven't got their $motoko yet. It he is not alone by this stand, it is confirmed again again by team they are having problems with airdrop, as they can't get the claim site work correct. So X amount of people are missing out\n\nI can't complain, as most of you in here you got the airdrop just fine. But then you also have the option to sell. I did that. I sold for an average of 55 $ICP. So again can't complain - but those who are not in the position to sell as they haven't received their airdrop - are entitled to their frustrations.\n\nI also understand @accumulating is a respected member of IC, but that doesn't mean he didn't invested in his own idea before pitching it for Sonic etc. It's not like it's 1-2 NFTs - it is a lot. Even if he bases his investment on the branding of Motoko - it doesn't mean he didn't know something before all of us. He or @notforsale22 doesn't have to prove anything. The data is public, so if anybody dive into this - the proof will be there.

I bought 25 Mokoto NFT’s last week after listening to BobbyO on YT. Never owned an NFT before that. Value has dropped about 50% so far. I should have done more research, I know.\n\nI was expecting to have my tokens to be able to sell them and regain some of the loses. I have submitted to claim portal but don’t have any tokens. The price keeps going down as I am writing this.\n\nI’m very concerned at this point. The account “accumulating” hosted the spaces yesterday. Apparently they are behind the token.

This could be over a 2 week period where users would complete this process. A registry would be kept (linking owners with amounts). Users that lock tokens in the canister would receive an airdrop of MOTOKOSNS when the SNS proposal is approved\n2) Toniq would buy 1 $MOTOKO from the openmarket, and burn it (send it to a burn address)\n3) The SNS proposal would sell 1 MOTOKOSNS for the value of the treasury at the time.
