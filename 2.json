A Motoko DAO is being established for a variety of reasons but primarily to take custody of that asset and vote on its distribution.\n\nThe other 1% is a hardcoded marketplace fee, which Stephen (CTO Toniq) put in place to direct all mp fees to Toniq. Stephen created the EXT standard and the Motoko Ghost canister. He was posting here in February but then disappeared. \n\n<@846842864650551346> has suggested that the DAO should now retrospectively allocate funds to Poked despite prior contracts stating these royalties belong to the Motoko Ghost community. Here is an alternative suggestion. Bob/Stephen/Toniq have been receiving a 1% mp fee since the beginning. If they want, take half of those mp's fees since 2021 and send them to Poked.

The 2.5% belongs to the Motoko Ghost NFT community. You know, the members here who have been buying all the nft's and supporting this collection/brand for almost 3 years now. A Motoko DAO is being established for a variety of reasons but primarily to take custody of that asset and vote on its distribution.\n\nThe other 1% is a hardcoded marketplace fee, which Stephen (CTO Toniq) put in place to direct all mp fees to Toniq. Stephen created the EXT standard and the Motoko Ghost canister. He was posting here in February but then disappeared. \n\n@bobbodily has suggested that the DAO should now retrospectively allocate funds to Poked despite prior contracts stating these royalties belong to the Motoko Ghost community. Here is an alternative suggestion. Bob/Stephen/Toniq have been receiving a 1% mp fee since the beginning. If they want, take half of those mp's fees since 2021 and send them to Poked.

From my time in this group, I have only grown in respect for you and your work.\n\nHowever, there are too many unknowns. DAO members cannot vote accurately on important matters without knowing the finer details of prior arrangements.

We do not know DFINITY's position. \n\nI agree completely with Accum. in that we should wait on the swaps to complete and then begin voting through the SNS. Also, to the rest of the members here. It is not my intention to clog up this space with these technicalities. I think the DAO is moving in a positive direction.

I'll try to clear things up (big CYA... I do not represent DFINITY legal) ...\n\nOn IP - DFINITY owns the trademark to Motoko under many different trademark classes.  DFINITY has also followed the web3 example set by the Ethereum Foundation in very loosely managing/enforcing that trademark.  I can't say that will always be the case, but it is the case today (with obvious exceptions for illicit or untorrid usages).  MOTOKO DAO (or any other Motoko project) use the trademark somewhat at risk and should they worry about DFINITY changing its stance on its trademark, is free to discuss getting legal rights to the trademark.  This may be advantageous if the DAO becomes large enough and participants (with large financial pr other stakes) begin to worry about a risk of DFINITY \"rugging\" the trademark.  It's fully up to the DAO how they want to engage with DFINITY.  It should be said though (and I'm no lawyer, so this is just how I understand the situation based on a few convos with lawyers) that legal agreements in which one side receives something and the other side does not actually open up a lot of legal risk.  So (and again, I'm one of the decision makers on this within DFINITY) I would expect DFINITY to have some requests, like \"in exchange for access to the motoko trademark, MOTOKO DAO will do xyz...\".

What licenses/IP/copyright is granted to the DAO regarding the Motoko brand, trademark, assets, etc. This will essentially enable the DAO to run without having to consult with Dfinity every time they want to do something.\n\nThe solution I was discussing above where we fund a 1:1 swap audit would be more of a one-off payment for a specific purpose. If the community was in favor, I would need to discuss with Dfinity legal to ensure this wasn't infringing on any Dfinity copyright/trademark/IP, and then we could do it. The bigger DAO discussions happening are kind of solving the legal issues for the future.","attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2024-05-23T17:05:34.337000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1243248472724078763","author":{"id":"846842864650551346","username":"bobbodily","avatar":"deaaa06d2f5a1011ae7c8f2f5604d4a6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Bob Bodily","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"mentions":[{"id":"207300461554958336","username":"accumulating","avatar":"6b30b49b5be82b7293c7eb167bc2d35b","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Accumulating","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","message_id":"1243245098871820388","guild_id":"905854635405889546"},"position":0},"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"accumulating"},{"id":"1243267402309832806","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"401430070947872778","username":"jarko1","avatar":"6442b953688e7f20278e5b33c1703a48","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"jarko1","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"I hope","timestamp":"2024-05-23T18:20:47.502000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"759627682337521695","username":"benchmouse","avatar":"c570a5c6467fd4684f363b5c756ebcab","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"benchmouse","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","message_id":"1243258710432940105","guild_id":"905854635405889546"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":19,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","content":"I think we'll have time.

the safer option with stoic).
