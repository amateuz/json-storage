However, as this community has pointed out, that vision lacks in marketing and community building.  We are officially putting out an RFP (request for proposal) for anyone in the Sentinels community regarding creation and execution of a marketing plan and/or a community management/expansion plan.  Everyone is invited to submit a proposal to the community.  The community will decide which proposal(s) move forwards.  More info to follow.\n3 - For Sentinels, there may be additional needs for paid roles outside of community-building and marketing, it's tbd, as discussions are still early.  But to give a taste of what I am thinking, there may be an opportunity for an AI component in the collection and that may require another RFP (so don't spend all the mint on marketing üôÇ ).\n4 - Bob and I have met with some journalists interested in the Sentinels story.  Possible to start seeing some press coverage as early as Monday.\n5 - There's additional promotions planned with other ICP apps, most notably DSCVR, but discussions/planning are still ongoing, so no commitments at this time.\n6 - Regarding the 41 unaccounted airdrop Sentinels, Bob will provide an accurate account.  Mostly the error lied in us failing to account for changes in a spreadsheet.  All Sentinels are accounted for though...\n7 - Finally, the three of us want to remind the community that we are committed to decentralizing this project.  Phase 2 of the game is intended to take another step in that direction.  Ultimately, Sentinels should be fully-decentralized, and we'd like to make that process both fun and fair in order to set a precedent in the industry.","attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2024-04-26T18:34:32.443000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-26T18:35:56.574000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1233486389991964792","author":{"id":"914672135786598451","username":"kylelangham","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"kylelangham","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false},"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"blabongbong"},{"id":"1233616302535610448","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"909153099027972117","username":"king20022","avatar":"db297945b35fe112addde24fa76363ba","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ùóûùó∂ùóªùó¥.ùó∂ùó∞ùóΩ","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"I'm not good at nfts as I normally buy and don't sell.

However, as this community has pointed out, that vision lacks in marketing and community building.  We are officially putting out an RFP (request for proposal) for anyone in the Sentinels community regarding creation and execution of a marketing plan and/or a community management/expansion plan.  Everyone is invited to submit a proposal to the community.  The community will decide which proposal(s) move forwards.  More info to follow.\n3 - For Sentinels, there may be additional needs for paid roles outside of community-building and marketing, it's tbd, as discussions are still early.  But to give a taste of what I am thinking, there may be an opportunity for an AI component in the collection and that may require another RFP (so don't spend all the mint on marketing üôÇ ).\n4 - Bob and I have met with some journalists interested in the Sentinels story.  Possible to start seeing some press coverage as early as Monday.\n5 - There's additional promotions planned with other ICP apps, most notably DSCVR, but discussions/planning are still ongoing, so no commitments at this time.\n6 - Regarding the 41 unaccounted airdrop Sentinels, Bob will provide an accurate account.  Mostly the error lied in us failing to account for changes in a spreadsheet.  All Sentinels are accounted for though...\n7 - Finally, the three of us want to remind the community that we are committed to decentralizing this project.  Phase 2 of the game is intended to take another step in that direction.  Ultimately, Sentinels should be fully-decentralized, and we'd like to make that process both fun and fair in order to set a precedent in the industry.","attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2024-04-26T18:34:32.443000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-26T18:35:56.574000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1233486389991964792","author":{"id":"914672135786598451","username":"kylelangham","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"kylelangham","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false},"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"icpinvestor"},{"id":"1233528508945268747","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"1213561084489769010","username":"zen_piglet_46902","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"chris.icp","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"like

However, as this community has pointed out, that vision lacks in marketing and community building.  We are officially putting out an RFP (request for proposal) for anyone in the Sentinels community regarding creation and execution of a marketing plan and/or a community management/expansion plan.  Everyone is invited to submit a proposal to the community.  The community will decide which proposal(s) move forwards.  More info to follow.\n3 - For Sentinels, there may be additional needs for paid roles outside of community-building and marketing, it's tbd, as discussions are still early.  But to give a taste of what I am thinking, there may be an opportunity for an AI component in the collection and that may require another RFP (so don't spend all the mint on marketing üôÇ ).\n4 - Bob and I have met with some journalists interested in the Sentinels story.  Possible to start seeing some press coverage as early as Monday.\n5 - There's additional promotions planned with other ICP apps, most notably DSCVR, but discussions/planning are still ongoing, so no commitments at this time.\n6 - Regarding the 41 unaccounted airdrop Sentinels, Bob will provide an accurate account.  Mostly the error lied in us failing to account for changes in a spreadsheet.  All Sentinels are accounted for though...\n7 - Finally, the three of us want to remind the community that we are committed to decentralizing this project.  Phase 2 of the game is intended to take another step in that direction.  Ultimately, Sentinels should be fully-decentralized, and we'd like to make that process both fun and fair in order to set a precedent in the

Maybe some other initial testing not with Motoko would have been a better start. I've also personally been pretty unimpressed with the Sentinals design diversity. They all kind of look the same.

The fact that Solana periodically goes on vacation is laughed at by everyone, regardless of belonging to any blockchain :)\n\nPersonally, I don't understand the desire to attract users from Solana to the NFT environment of the ICP ecosystem. For most people on Solana, NFTs are a worthless asset for instant sale once minted. Because of this, they are disliked in the Ordinals ecosystem, for example.\n\n2 & 3. In the time since Solana was integrated into DSCVR, if I'm not mistaken, not a single collection that was distributed via Lootboxes has gone popular. In fact, the Lootboxes have become a mailing list of promotional flyers from various portals.\nIf Bioniq is going to create and distribute a collection via Lootboxes, it's vital that the collection be liquid and give Solana users a chance to earn money (that's all they need).\n\n5. That's a good suggestion. But I hope that someday Rick and his team will create their own nft marketplace. I've been asking them to for years now :)\n\nPersonally, looking at how Solana users have behaved on the Bitcoin blockchain, I think the best strategy is to drop a few Bioniq collections to users of portals dedicated to Solana. Then drop a couple collections to holders of Solana's top collections. Then it's imperative to make sure these collections are liquid so that Solana users can make a profit. Then it is necessary to organize several sales with a white list for Solana users and also to provide at least a small but profit (at least x2). After that we should see if their predatory gaze will turn to Bioniq as a means of possible earnings :)\n\nAnd I'll say it again - in the nft ecosystems of various blockchains, users from Solana are not liked. Sometimes they literally kill collections, selling at a loss if the collection did not immediately show a good price at the start of sales. I don't understand the targeting of these people.","timestamp":"2024-04-26T03:54:51.849000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-26T04:04:39.697000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"730640931040002131","username":"stofaxecapital","avatar":"9995e77f61e8dbb18fe27cf3e80cb302","discriminator":"0","public_flags":256,"flags":256,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Kyle Stoflet","avatar_decoration_data":{"asset":"a_e90ebc0114e7bdc30353c8b11953ea41","sku_id":"1197344326133502032"},"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","message_id":"1233126645041332305","guild_id":"905854635405889546"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":19,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","content":"1.

DSCVR Loot Boxes are SOL Compressed NFTs. These become immediately listed on Magic Eden. Which can be bought on DSCVR through embedded profile links.\n\n3.

I dont think its fair for the Sentinels to start loosing XP so quickly. I was gone for about 8 hours yesterday, when I left all my Sentinels were on missions. When I got home several of my Sentinels were damaged and already lost 10 XP each. People work and have a life, we cant just sit on the computer all day waiting for our Sentinels to come back from missions. I would suggest that when they do get damaged that they don't start loosing XP for 24hrs or at least 12hrs. Not cool to come home from work and see a bunch of your Sentinels already lost XP.

DSCVR Loot Boxes are SOL Compressed NFTs. These become immediately listed on Magic Eden. Which can be bought on DSCVR through embedded profile links.\n\n3. Design a series of Artworks that tie back to a DSCVR Portal and can help influence Reserve Ordinals. I previously mentioned this to you for the ckBTC Portal.

We need to agree on 2-3 common tags for consistency - $Motoko #ordinals $BTC, etc. Then we all use those same tags when posting anything about motoko sentinels.\n\n2. The bionic twitter account is a joke. It needs to be sorted, asap. You get more buy-in from people if they are a part of the creative process. We can craft tweets here as a community and release them through the bioniq account. Then everyone here RT, etc.\n\n‚Ä®‚Ä®3. All branding should remain consistent. We now have motoko ghosts/mechs/sentinels. The runes ticker should also start with motoko. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n4. Marketing to ordinal communities - needs to be targeted, ongoing and consistent. From my understanding, Bob and his crew have the best relationships there. Craft guerrilla marketing campaigns here that we can all rally behind. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n5. Marketing conversations between 3 individuals (you, Bob, kyle?) is pointless. If you want buy-in from us, those conversations need to be open. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n6. The big players still have not changed their pfp‚Äôs from what I can see. This is a joke. pfp is the best marketing for an nft collection. all the people at Bioniq including you should change pfp to sentinels for an upcoming promo. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n7. The next step is the glitched sentinel promo. Once the selection canister is in order we need to craft that promo here. This is not complicated. Here are some basic ideas:‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n**GLITCH SENTINEL PROMO**\n\n‚Ä®‚Ä®(i) The promo should include a motoko sentinel giveaway. Use one from the team wallet. ‚Ä®\n(ii) To qualify for the promo, everyone needs to change their pfp to a sentinel they own + like/rt.

What ghosts do varies depending on cultural beliefs and individual interpretations. Some common beliefs about ghosts include:\n\nHaunting: Ghosts are often associated with haunted locations, where they may linger due to unfinished business, a strong emotional attachment to a place, or a traumatic event that occurred there.\nManifestations: Ghosts are said to sometimes manifest themselves to the living through visual apparitions, auditory phenomena (such as footsteps or voices), or by affecting the environment (such as moving objects or changes in temperature).\nCommunication: Some people believe that ghosts may attempt to communicate with the living through various means, such as EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena), ouija boards, or dreams.\nResidual Energy: In some beliefs, ghosts are not conscious entities but rather residual energy left behind by past events, replaying like a recording under certain conditions.\nGuidance or Protection: In certain cultures, ancestors or guardian spirits are believed to watch over and protect their descendants or loved ones.\nOf course, beliefs about ghosts vary widely across different cultures and individuals, ranging from traditional spiritual beliefs to skepticism rooted in scientific inquiry. Ultimately, what ghosts do is a matter of personal belief and interpretation.","timestamp":"2024-04-24T14:40:49.558000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"935925600957366363","username":"skyhasjuice","avatar":"4db3b808b77a2ea1af8d348e7f9ccbc6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Skyhasjuice0","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üíØ"},"count":2,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":2},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","message_id":"1232702540848697454","guild_id":"905854635405889546"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","content":"What do Ghosts do again?

We need to agree on 2-3 common tags for consistency - $Motoko #ordinals $BTC, etc. Then we all use those same tags when posting anything about motoko sentinels.\n\n2. The bionic twitter account is a joke. It needs to be sorted, asap. You get more buy-in from people if they are a part of the creative process. We can craft tweets here as a community and release them through the bioniq account. Then everyone here RT, etc.\n\n‚Ä®‚Ä®3. All branding should remain consistent. We now have motoko ghosts/mechs/sentinels. The runes ticker should also start with motoko. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n4. Marketing to ordinal communities - needs to be targeted, ongoing and consistent. From my understanding, Bob and his crew have the best relationships there. Craft guerrilla marketing campaigns here that we can all rally behind. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n5. Marketing conversations between 3 individuals (you, Bob, kyle?) is pointless. If you want buy-in from us, those conversations need to be open. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n6. The big players still have not changed their pfp‚Äôs from what I can see. This is a joke. pfp is the best marketing for an nft collection. all the people at Bioniq including you should change pfp to sentinels for an upcoming promo. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n7. The next step is the glitched sentinel promo. Once the selection canister is in order we need to craft that promo here. This is not complicated. Here are some basic ideas:‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\n**GLITCH SENTINEL PROMO**\n\n‚Ä®‚Ä®(i) The promo should include a motoko sentinel giveaway. Use one from the team wallet. ‚Ä®\n(ii) To qualify for the promo, everyone needs to change their pfp to a sentinel they own + like/rt.

All the basics.\n(iii) Everyone at Bioniq and Poked changes their pfp to a sentinel (don‚Äôt worry!! you can change back after the promo).\n(iv) Craft the promo post here so you get buy-in. ‚Ä®\n(v) Reach out to your connections in icp to distribute the promo, etc.","timestamp":"2024-04-24T12:24:02.393000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"871077650037350420","username":"pokedstudio","avatar":"e35e21c7648e8123a7c22a6f8090e188","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"pokedstudio","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üî•"},"count":9,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":9},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0},{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üíØ"},"count":5,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":5},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","message_id":"1232605852469297152","guild_id":"905854635405889546"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","content":"what constitutes a good promo in your opinion?","attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2024-04-24T08:15:35.938000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1232605852469297152","author":{"id":"871077650037350420","username":"pokedstudio","avatar":"e35e21c7648e8123a7c22a6f8090e188","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"pokedstudio","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false},"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"icpinvestor"},{"id":"1232641816822808718","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"862716350992351232","username":"grich3891","avatar":"b0f04c0c54c760843a91e3ea8b21a163","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Grich","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"my motoko has finished mission and has XP but says its still on mission?","timestamp":"2024-04-24T10:38:30.508000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"grich3891"},{"id":"1232637785576312912","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"690544382126063636","username":"jdog4581","avatar":"6cb36d348fde57798a772e92450d1b2e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"j-dog","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"No layers just a few repairs in the motoko chop shop hahaha","timestamp":"2024-04-24T10:22:29.384000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üî•"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"jdog4581"},{"id":"1232636263149080646","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"1041679912416837683","username":"dog_icp","avatar":"05ded6d48db4d2d292254e2c3693b116","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"DOG ICP","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"OMG.

Here is the call summary (for extra transparency):**\n\n1. Drop repair costs from 500 sats -> 100 sats (we're here to ensure people have ckBTC to transact, not to punish whales that have to upgrade dozens and dozens of Motokos).\n\n2. Glitch will be randomly distributed as airdrop to a lucky Motoko Sentinel holder (as discussed previously here, works best)\n\n3. A portion of revenue from the launch will go to cover Bioniq launch fee, Bioniq custom dev, Jon's artwork, and inscription fees on Bitcoin. The rest will go to treasury. Still finalizing percentages here.\n\n4. Motokos are separate from the Poked Bot ecosystem. There can be cross-overs, but they are clearly distinct communities (for legal reasons as well as separation of concerns reasons). So we'll leep the lore separate between Motokos and Poked Bots to keep distance between the two collections.\n\n5. It may be helpful to add a setting for users to add a parenthetical price in ICP instead of dollars for the ICP users in the community that prefer accounting in ICP (rather than ckBTC or $$).\n\n6. Simplify the process of onboarding from ICP -> ckBTC. Still painful to swap. Consider building in swapping functionality (and holding ICP) directly into Bioniq.\n\n7. We need to get listed on Crypto Slam (or other NFT tracking services). Anyone have any connections here? Let's get Motokos on the cross-chain map.\n\n8. Update on PR article. They want it a bit sexier. So we're spicing it up with data/future plans. A few more rounds of review before they start pitching to NFT outlets.\n\n9. This project only succeeds with community support. How can we effectively include people in building the Motoko lore, contributing to game mechanics, etc.?\n\n10. Some people have had bad luck with their Motokos on missions. Others have had crazy success. Maybe we have a leaderboard showing best Motoko of the week (best luck on missions) and worst motoko of the week (worst luck on missions).","attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2024-04-23T17:58:13.839000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-04-23T18:07:31.555000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1232390088667828355","author":{"id":"846842864650551346","username":"bobbodily","avatar":"deaaa06d2f5a1011ae7c8f2f5604d4a6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Bob
