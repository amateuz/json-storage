So how it works on ETH is you have a marketplace canister that facilitates the listings, offers, collection offers, approvals, transferFroms, etc. So you have to build a marketplace canister that will facilitate all of this. This doesn't mean decentralization. It could be a very centralized marketplace canister (and likely would be initially). This is essentially Seaport for OpenSea.\n\nSo I agree that the approve/transferFrom model enables marketplaces that can choose their own fees, but you have to manage those fees yourself in your own marketplace canister. So you're basically just building a marketplace backend at that point. And you could do this right now (build your own marketplace backend canister) in a permissionless, Toniq-royalty-free way.\n\nSo I'm not understanding how approve/transferFrom actually enables anything for you.

Disagree slightly with the infighting comment as I see it only as constructive discussion but it is a matter of perspective. With regards to point 1., the problem I find with big thinkers is they can take forever to get started. A 12 month plan is great in theory but literally and as @robinet8ic said, just make a tweet. Literally, just do one giveaway. \n\nTrial and error is key and often it's just a case of throwing enough at the wall until something sticks. If you are unsure what to tweet/giveaway then a great strategy is community involvement. Ask the group here to construct the tweet/giveaway. Then state the day/time of same so everyone is aware and can spread it upon execution.","timestamp":"2024-05-16T18:03:57.123000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"207300461554958336","username":"accumulating","avatar":"6b30b49b5be82b7293c7eb167bc2d35b","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Accumulating","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},{"id":"914672135786598451","username":"kylelangham","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"kylelangham","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},{"id":"532925613380599810","username":"robinet8ic","avatar":"9b6c1cc4cfbf0b2db0fddfaf792adb4b","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Robinet","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},{"id":"797126828686966848","username":"_cartographer_","avatar":"39f2fba6f10aaede287ba96797cdaa40","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Cartographer","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üëç"},"count":2,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":2},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","message_id":"1240715611848310885","guild_id":"905854635405889546"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":19,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","content":"In the interest of opening up a conversation around bettering the Motoko Universe and ICP NFTs in general, interested in a few thoughts from this community:\n1.

We all share the same passion, and being part of Motoko Doodles, we deeply respect Motoko Ghosts and its creator. From the outset, we've emphasized that the inspiration extends to the entire community, not just us.\n\nNow, onto the issue at hand: why are some Motoko members becoming aggressive towards Doodles? Art is subjective. If you appreciate it, you engage, if not, you move on, without targeting creators. Whether Motoko Doodles is officially recognized or not, for us, it is 100% official. Dismissing other art forms until Dfinity creates and endorses them seems limiting to the creative spirit of the ICP community.\n\nAddressing pricing, our success in sales demonstrates significant community interest. We've been transparent about our team not profiting from Doodles. We've upheld our promise by refraining from holding or selling our marketing doodles or purchasing new ones.\n\nLastly, a note to <@1041679912416837683> and <@909153099027972117>: we haven't targeted or harmed anyone in the ICP community. Let's support each other rather than spreading negativity.\n\nAlso, thank you <@1197505314887585852> for appreciating our promotions. We're committed to maintaining our hard work and dedication.","attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2024-05-13T12:37:02.324000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1239557015387242517","author":{"id":"1237811722627186721","username":"motokodoodles_63682","avatar":"d12199a28543e4de8e91462fa65b9d9f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Motoko Doodles","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"mentions":[{"id":"1041679912416837683","username":"dog_icp","avatar":"05ded6d48db4d2d292254e2c3693b116","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"DOG ICP","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},{"id":"1197505314887585852","username":"richuk_75922","avatar":"5668c1c76d287e398ec946dc2fd8fb5e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ICP plumber","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},{"id":"909153099027972117","username":"king20022","avatar":"db297945b35fe112addde24fa76363ba","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"ùóûùó∂ùóªùó¥.ùó∂ùó∞ùóΩ","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false},"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"king20022"},{"id":"1239616335781036074","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"245457787163770880","username":"stipe32","avatar":"f2b5a72360a0aa079cf8a60329bd01a4","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"(‡∏á'ÃÄ-'ÃÅ)‡∏á","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Hope to see someone rocking it soon üëÄ","timestamp":"2024-05-13T16:32:45.408000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-05-13T16:32:49.754000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üî•"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"stipe32"},{"id":"1239616283146846230","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"245457787163770880","username":"stipe32","avatar":"f2b5a72360a0aa079cf8a60329bd01a4","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"(‡∏á'ÃÄ-'ÃÅ)‡∏á","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Would be my new pfp in a heartbeat","timestamp":"2024-05-13T16:32:32.859000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"stipe32"},{"id":"1239616233012203684","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"245457787163770880","username":"stipe32","avatar":"f2b5a72360a0aa079cf8a60329bd01a4","discriminator":"0","public_flags":64,"flags":64,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"(‡∏á'ÃÄ-'ÃÅ)‡∏á","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"Man that winner is lucky!
