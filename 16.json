BTC is the god chain. The development of ordinals has allowed for NFTs to live on the god chain. Additional developments on BTC such as upcoming Runes, TAP, PIPE, OP_Cat hype, along with the ETF approval and market-leading ath price action confirms that’s where the eyeballs and dollars are flowing. In the NFT world, BTC’s ordinals release has caused ETH nfts to develop further, including new token standards (like Pandora and recently Paradox). So, when it comes to NFTs, BTC is beginning to eat the lunch of other chains. Other chains need to do things with NFTs that BTC can’t. Not sure what this means for Motoko. But any way ICP can align itself with BTC just means more eyeballs. The upcoming release of VC-funded Bitfinity should play a role in this. In terms of what’s out there, Merlin is a layer 2 solution in development for BTC and its platform  is nowhere near ICP’s alien tech. Yet Merlin is accelerating TVL as a leader in that area. I kno this post is all over the place, and ICP has organic growth with builders recognizing superiority over time. ICP hasn’t resorted to meme coin hype chicanery to generate buzz. Its growth is pure tech and utility. When I think about Motoko, it’s like the Bitcoin motto, Bitcoin fixes this, but really, the Motoko language fixes this. And maybe thats where our Motoko ghosts and the Motoko token come in to play. How do the ghosts and token evangelize ICPs utility in the context of current BTC buzz (since that’s where an inordinate amount of attention is currently being funneled)? Can the Motoko ghosts become emblematic of achieving some aspect of Satoshi’s vision - whether it’s scaling BTC as a layer 2 (like chain-key BTC on ICP, or the NFT inscription tool recently deployed on Bioniq)? If ICP is ultimately gonna become the true Internet Computer in the future, then maybe the Motoko ghosts and token can start that journey in some way now, through some link to the god chain BTC.","timestamp":"2024-03-07T00:53:17.264000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":"parlayability"},{"id":"1215099854959804476","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"679097884053995551","username":"parlayability","avatar":"d4583dac243261b7f23d7c0722c94514","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":null,"avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"There’s a point to be made here.

I feel everyone is just spinning out because of the price actions of other cryptos at the moment. Ppl need to chill and focus on promoting a welcoming and fun motoko space that happens to be part of the icp ecosystem. Icp is complex in nature. Motoko doesn't have to be. If we focus too much on icp, we lose ppl who just don't want to be bothered with understanding it. But if we offer an easy way for them to join motoko, and from there they can learn more about icp at their own chosen speed, we might be able to connect with more

There were 2 options of DEXes to team with, I chose the one that I have better experiences with. It has nothing to do with legitimacy and everything to do with bringing the token to market.\n\n3. Yes, I asked people to check out Motoko - is that a crime..? I didn’t know I am not allowed to use my social media to ask people to look at the work I’m doing…?\n\nTo say “I knew I had the contacts to pull this off” is insane. Before $STACK, I had a terrible relationship with Cakemaker due to the SNS Due Diligence I did blocking their initial SNS, and we still **frequently** clash & disagree. Before $MOTOKO, Jon and I rarely spoke, aside from him telling me to give DFINITY a bit more slack in response to my frequent twitter rants.

It was explicitly stated that DFINITY is NOT involved in genesis on multiple accounts, although at this point Kyle has publicly stated they do support $MOTOKO & we have been working behind the scenes to achieve an SNS. \n\n2. There were 2 options of DEXes to team with, I chose the one that I have better experiences with. It has nothing to do with legitimacy and everything to do with bringing the token to market.\n\n3. Yes, I asked people to check out Motoko - is that a crime..? I didn’t know I am not allowed to use my social media to ask people to look at the work I’m doing…?\n\nTo say “I knew I had the contacts to pull this off” is insane. Before $STACK, I had a terrible relationship with Cakemaker due to the SNS Due Diligence I did blocking their initial SNS, and we still **frequently** clash & disagree. Before $MOTOKO, Jon and I rarely spoke, aside from him telling me to give DFINITY a bit more slack in response to my frequent twitter rants. Again, before $MOTOKO, I have not had a positive relationship with DFINITY either - you’ve all seen my forums account, and know they don’t like me.  \n\nThere were multiple points & reasons where someone could have said “no, I don’t think this should happen”, so it’s insane that you’re going to tell me I knew I had the contacts to make this happen 😐\n\nI did not frontrun.","timestamp":"2024-02-13T12:55:44.198000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2024-02-13T13:05:43.562000+00:00","tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"885459060072267778","username":"thelandlordtrilogyray609","avatar":"a769b1470f28d04f065137625f318fa6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Thelandlord","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"💯"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","message_id":"1206944903670669332","guild_id":"905854635405889546"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":19,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","content":"Bro noone is naive.
