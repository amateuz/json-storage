Registry is hard to pull right now, which is precisely why I haven't given you the info as pulling the registry at scale right now puts a lot of strain on our canisters. You have to (1) grab the registry the way you were initially pulling it, (2) go to our EXT wrapper canister and one-by-one request the owner associated with each address. This just doesn't work at scale at all. It barely works to pull a single time. So we're fixing this (making it real easy) and when we've fixed it, we'll give you the API endpoint for it.\n\n2. There is no unfair advantage here on getting access to the Bioniq repo. They contacted us 8 months ago, wanted to build an ordinals marketplace and auction launchpad, and so we added them to the repo and they've been building a Bioniq SDK of sorts to use for development. Cart, we've been DMing long enough, you can just ask me for things and I'll usually just give it to you. Send me your Github and I'll add you to the repo.

We would much prefer to be able to support this project and would like to see it play out where Bioniq and dgdg are both successful and the community is happy.\n\nCurrently:\n- we still lack basic information for how to pull the registry. We don't need an easy-button as much as just a high-level explanation of where to get it. The how here likely doesn't need any explanation, closest to the source is preferred. It's somewhat relevant that we've been waiting for information on how to pull the transaction data for offers over a year now.\nhttps://x.com/BobBodily/status/1628813695605407745\n\n- we don't yet have access to the repository ,*while other team/s have been given the unfair advantage of getting this early*, not sure what the reasoning is here but I don't really expect a straight answer. \n\n*Being knowledge-gated, particularly for things that have no good reason of being private has been a common theme in the ICP eco for us. Take ICP.lab for example, an invite-only event where chosen teams get to network amongst eachother and dfinity engineers at the headquarters to get things done and cowork on things. There were presentations/slides from this event that seemed like valuable information that  I don't believe ever made it to the public domain, I asked a few times (https://x.com/dgdg_app/status/1626160428383408132) and was just ignored. For anyone developing a product here, information like this can be critical and if gated from it you are immediately put at a disadvantage. The point I'm trying to make here is that it has always been the vibe we get here, not just from Toniq, but from the foundation itself.*\n\n(accidentally hit enter, still typing...)","attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"rich","url":"https://twitter.com/BobBodily/status/1628813695605407745","title":"Bob Bodily, PhD üëã | #BTC #ETH #ICP üßôüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (@BobBodily) on X","description":"@dgdg_app @SaorsaLabs @pokedstudiouk Yes txn/event archive is all on chainüëç\n\nWill get it out public soon","color":1942002,"timestamp":"2023-02-23T17:47:01.584000+00:00","reference_id":"1238110596784848906","footer":{"text":"Twitter","icon_url":"https://abs.twimg.com/icons/apple-touch-icon-192x192.png","proxy_icon_url":"https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/bXJWV2Y_F3XSra_kEqIYXAAsI3m1meckfLhYuWzxIfI/https/abs.twimg.com/icons/apple-touch-icon-192x192.png"},"content_scan_version":1},{"type":"rich","url":"https://twitter.com/dgdg_app/status/1626160428383408132","title":"DGDG (dgastonia) (@dgdg_app) on X","description":"@rckprtr Seems to be the same issue you're having.\n\nSaw this a while back being nosey during the defi lab, ...

You're complaining about the difficulty to interact with Bitcoin. Sure.\n\n> Really, the migration of what is in essence the entire NFT ecosystem to-date to this new standard\n\nThis \"new standard\" for ICP NFTs is likely ICRC-7. Anyone can do whatever they want with these canisters. There is no closed garden. There are no walls. There is no custom code planned for these canisters to \"lock\" them in anywhere. Just go build a marketplace smart contract to support your product.\n\n> Also, fun fact, you cannot even make a ckBTC transaction without Toniq claiming a fee on it.\n\nThis is false. No fees are charged for ckBTC transfers anywhere. Just the normal 10 sat fee the canister itself charges.","attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2024-05-08T16:54:37.272000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1237809898809462877","author":{"id":"846842864650551346","username":"bobbodily","avatar":"deaaa06d2f5a1011ae7c8f2f5604d4a6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Bob Bodily","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false},"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"_cartographer_"},{"id":"1237953906403708928","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"344123206174507009","username":".merzi2","avatar":"aae0c562621f564524974556dc78b523","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"derp","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"it worked. thanks üòÑ","timestamp":"2024-05-09T02:26:51.358000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"‚ù§Ô∏è"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":".merzi2"},{"id":"1237952695491493948","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"344123206174507009","username":".merzi2","avatar":"aae0c562621f564524974556dc78b523","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"derp","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"i had it working on mozilla using, private window","timestamp":"2024-05-09T02:22:02.654000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":".merzi2"},{"id":"1237951923659866225","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"344123206174507009","username":".merzi2","avatar":"aae0c562621f564524974556dc78b523","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"derp","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"If i used chrome.. nothing","timestamp":"2024-05-09T02:18:58.635000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":".merzi2"},{"id":"1237951777580519565","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"344123206174507009","username":".merzi2","avatar":"aae0c562621f564524974556dc78b523","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"derp","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"i cannot open NNS in mozilla","timestamp":"2024-05-09T02:18:23.807000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":0,"flags":0,"components":[],"userName":".merzi2"},{"id":"1237951242999693362","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"207300461554958336","username":"accumulating","avatar":"6b30b49b5be82b7293c7eb167bc2d35b","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Accumulating","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"This is the resolution.

Here's what happens when you reach level 4:\n- You will have the ability to inscribe your Sentinel to Bitcoin, meaning it will be a true ordinal that will live forward on the OG blockchain.  It will also be listable on other marketplaces, but that also requires someone setting up the collection on another marketplace.\n- Only inscribed Sentinels will be able to play Game 2, which will be a long term, mass multiplayer cooperative game.  The game will make use of the runes you are farming on your missions.  I think most people will find Game 2 to be a killer use case of Sentinels that will attract ordinal collectors and NFT collectors from other ecosystems like SOL to the collection.  More info will come out as Sentinels reach level 4.\n- We are also exploring \"play your way to decentralization\", utilizing Game 2's mechanics for continued decentralization of the collection

I guess these are the 2 biggest on my mind without knowing anything else.","timestamp":"2024-05-04T09:04:03.571000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"846842864650551346","username":"bobbodily","avatar":"deaaa06d2f5a1011ae7c8f2f5604d4a6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Bob Bodily","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","message_id":"1235792341235662848","guild_id":"905854635405889546"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":19,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","content":"The point I am trying to make here is if you believe in Ordinals (NFTs, aka images connected to sats), you have to be ok with trusting the ordinals team. It is a fairly centralized protocol governed by Casey and co. It has come a long way since the beginning, but you are 100% trusting the off-chain ordinals team/protocol/indexer. So you could argue that Ordinals are not non-custodial because you don't truly, exclusively own your own asset forever. You have to trust.\n\nOn ETH, it is very easy to fully decentralize a smart contract. You just pay the storage costs, and you're good to go. Pay $1-2k and store your smart contract on ETH. It is stored there forever. No maintenance required. Nobody can change it. \n\nOn ICP, it is very hard to fully decentralize a smart contract. The protocol is constantly changing and upgrading, so things that you previously deployed might actually not work in the future (occasionally breaking changes get pushed out). Then you have to deal with storage, aka increasing state (there's only so much storage in a canister, and if you go too high your canister dies). Then you have to deal with lots of limitations in the protocol (instruction limit, cross-canister call wait times, boundary node DDOS protection, etc). \n\nOur goal is to fully decentralize everything on the ICP side (Toniq/Entrepot) as well as the BTC side (Bioniq). We are on a path of progressive decentralization. We finally have a path forward on the ICP side (essentially rip marketplace methods out of each canister, trim them down so they are super simple - just registry, transfer, images) and then we can blackhole them all and turn cycles management over to the community. On the Bioniq side, we have a nice multi-sig setup all ready to go, we just need to find the right signers for it. And then eventually we'll push for blackholing these canisters as well once we feel the Internet Computer Protocol is stable enough to handle it.","attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2024-05-03T03:17:34.062000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1235792341235662848","author":{"id":"846842864650551346","username":"bobbodily","avatar":"deaaa06d2f5a1011ae7c8f2f5604d4a6","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Bob Bodily","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"mentions":[{"id":"1217854804483903601","username":"type2dev","avatar":"fcc28eb034f3bf4af9204c0169cf0b82","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"type2dev","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"mention_roles":[],"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","message_id":"1235790544848814150","guild_id":"905854635405889546"},"position":0},"components":[],"position":0,"userName":"_cartographer_"},{"id":"1236231447711453245","channel_id":"905854636039237665","author":{"id":"884987588887322674","username":"vivianannie","avatar":"a8a4346eada0f70f4f55896297af1097","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Vivian1","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null},"content":"My motoko ran into a problem yesterday, I had to repair üòÖ, I felt weird that yesterday ü§ìüòÖüòÖ","timestamp":"2024-05-04T08:22:25.204000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"tts":false,"mention_everyone":false,"mentions":[{"id":"871077650037350420","username":"pokedstudio","avatar":"e35e21c7648e8123a7c22a6f8090e188","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"pokedstudio","avatar_decoration_data":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null}],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"üòÇ"},"count":5,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":5},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}],"pinned":false,"type":19,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","message_id":"1236225149855072289","guild_id":"905854635405889546"},"flags":0,"referenced_message":{"type":0,"channel_id":"905854636039237665","content":"Bob is working on a solution to the sync issue.
